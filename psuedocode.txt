1. If the number of players exceeds the amount of spaces on the board - 1, then throw an error that the game has too many
2. Before Game starts, choose a random starting point & update the board for each player. Spaces cannot overlap here. Does not require pthreads

	//First checks to see if the game is set to over via a global boolean controlled by the supervisor thread

	//Randomly chooses a spot on the board
	
	//If occupied by opposing team OR nobody:
		//If it is not a team's starting position:	
			//Take that space for their team
			//Check to see if they have majority of their 3x3 space (with the space they just conquered as the middle):
				//If yes majority, take all spaces within the 3x3
				//If no majority, do nothing
		//If it is, do nothing
		
	//If it belongs to your own team:
		//If it's a starting space, do nothing
		//If it's not a starting space, make the space blank
